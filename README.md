# Sleaford East Lite Simulator

This repository contains a quick and dirty macro-based signal box simulator to run the Sleaford East recreation project.

The software is designed to run on Windows and have few requirements.

It provides a web interface to control the simulator, and the interfaces are also all connected via ethernet.

The ultimate goal is to replace this simulator with OpenSignalBox when complete.
